Participants: Mike, Ivo, Ben, Carl, Ravi, Nathan, Joe

Action Items:

Mike:
- make screenshots for demo tomorrow, share with group. Also, share URL for demo site if available for others to explore.
- longer term: adding metadata to facilitate linking search results to data on globus endpoint

Ivo:
- longer term: work on method to inject data to LONI pipeline from metadata generated by Mike (from bh: I’m not sure how to phrase this best - please help me with a better description)

Ravi:
- make first draft high-level block diagram of proposed integrated process we’ve been discussing and distribute to group for collaborative iteration

Ben:
- work with ISB team to generate summary genetic risk factor info (a cvs table) from existing SNP data in Plink files, send to Mike
- generate list of genomics data questions for Karen. Send to Mike

Joe:
- update/reminder email on scheduling upcoming NIH Demos

All:
- consider other possible use cases for the general BDDS paradigm; one is the proposed aD project


Group items to discuss in future meetings:
- make roadmap/timeline for integrating tools developed - adding metadata to faceted search tool to link search results to data on globus endpoint; using existing RESTful API to use those results to begin analysis on LONI pipeline

- Genomic analysis - what is the correct balance between pipeline development for sophisticated analysis and using previous results for generating features for integrated analysis?

- In general, what kind of ways to researchers want to work with data? (this could be an argument for more sophisticated genomic analysis, but requires close collaboration between genomic experts using tools and our working group helping enable their analysis)

- we seem to be near a transition point from assembling the feature matrix to beginning analysis on the data we’ve assembled. What’s our roadmap for that?


MEETING SUMMARY:
Mike has a presentable demo ready for tomorrow that enables a basic faceted search on a subset of the PPMI data. Ravi asked whether we might add metadata to point to the Globus Endpoint to facilitate work toward a future demo that integrates the 2 previous demos. Mike agreed that that may be good later, but not for tomorrow.

Carl asked about the 23 & Me data. Joe says it’s likely months off, so we’re currently focusing on PPMI data.

Ivo has completed processing the PPMI imaging data with the global shape analysis in the LONI pipeline, and is now integrating it with genomic and clinical summary data. He’s working with Eric for validation of the transproteomic pipeline implementations in Galaxy and the LONI pipeline.

Ravi has enabled the globus endpoint, so users can now se the PPMI data that Ivo put up (read only). Kyle documented technical implementation details in a google doc in the working group folder.

Ben reported that Gustavo at ISB has identified 39 useful genetic risk factors, and can generate a summary table of those genetic markers for subjects in the existing genomic data. Additional data would enable more sophisticated analysis (after the meeting, Gustavo told Ben that working with bam files is easier for him than working with the plink files).

Joe gave a brief update that he’s got a meeting scheduled with Judy Pa, from Art’s lab, for preliminary discussion about an alzheimer’s working group similar to this working group as another BDDS use case.
