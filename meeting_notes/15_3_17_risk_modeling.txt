MEETING SUMMARY:
attendees: Joe, Mike, Eric, Ben, Carl K, Ravi, Ivo, Carl from Chicago, Jack

Mike kicked the meeting off with an update on his work on the database - the data import is continuing, he had a productive meeting with Karen. He told us that the data dictionaries may present more information than is available in downloaded files - there is a process by which Karen and Art’s group removes subsets of data they’re aggregating (such as potentially personally identifiable information like timestamps). Additionally, Mike has found some particularly specific column names for some data, such as clinical tests that may be more meaningful to knowledge domain experts, but aren’t quickly interpretable.

Ben departed from the agenda to revisit Carl’s question of managing the risk of multiple copies of data. The group generally agreed that the ideal framework would be to have methods to go from a range of data sources to generate a feature matrix (columns of clinical or derived attributes with rows corresponding to observations for each subject) that could be used for subsequent integrated analysis. From the PPMI data, it appears that the features table we’re working on will have ~1500 attributes obtained from Mike’s database work, about 330 attributes derived from the LONI image analysis pipeline, and a handful of genomic attributes. Thus, we anticipate a features matrix that’s about 1830 columns by ~900 rows. (BH: upon typing these notes, I realize this may be the wrong number of rows - it should be 1 row per patient).

However, the group also recognizes that there’s not likely to be a magic wand to obtain and normalize un-normalized, un-structured data from arbitrary sources.

Ivo updated that the LONI implementation of the transproteomic pipeline is done, but has questions about its performance relative to the galaxy implementation, and wants to follow up with Eric and Ravi to cross validate and compare them.

Ravi has established a Globus endpoint server, and will create a shared endpoint for our access to PPMI data. Additionally, he’s sent documentation to Ivo to expand the LONI pipeline’s capabilities to use the Globus API to acquire data.

With time running short, Ben reported that the ISB team is working on genomic data validation and initial processing.

Joe updated that the monthly NIH call is next Wednesday, and the NIH Program Officers will join our working group calls on the first Tuesday of each month. He reminded us about the upcoming progress report, and requested that we send info about any papers that are published that are associated with the BDDS efforts.

Finally, Jack requested content that can be used for updating website information - an update that is planned to coincide with our NIH progress report submission.
